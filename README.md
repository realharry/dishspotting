# Dishspotting
> Foodspotting Resurrection


Food Spotting is no more. 
We will need a food spotting feature in our mobile app to encourage users to add more photos. 
This idea comprises three components:

1. Dish Spotting: A photo-taking screen to allow the user to take a picture of the dish within the app.
2. Dish Timeline: A user can view his/her own dish photos with timeline info.
3. Dish Stream: As the users upload their instant dish photos, we display them real time.
4. Public Timelines (Optional): Users’ dish timelines can be made public and viewable by other users. 


## Benefits

In the current app, the user takes pictures of food (e.g., using a camera app) and stores them. And, in the later phase while he/she is submitting a review they can attach the photos. This creates a lot of friction in uploading photos. By allowing the diners upload the photos instantly, while at the restaurant, and without requiring reviews, we can potentially increase the number of uploaded photos substantially.


## [1] Dish Spotting

We will need a photo-taking/upload screen in the app to allow the user to take a picture of the dish while dining. The screen should fit into the “reservation - dining - review” work flow. (This is a mobile only feature.)
The screen includes a link to the camera app, and once a photo is taken, it displays the upload page, optionally, with the ability to add comments, etc.
We may attach GPS/location information to the uploaded photos.
Optionally, we may include a placeholder screen with multiple photo locations to encourage users to upload more than one photos.

## [2] Dish Timeline

A user can view his/her own photo timeline with date/time and restaurant info, etc. This is like the user’s food diary.
This is important to give the users incentive to take photos. As the user takes/uploads more photos, his/her album/timeline will become more important, which in turn encourages the user to take more photos.
We can display the timeline photos in a reverse chronological order.

## [3] Dish Stream

As the users upload their instant dish photos, we display them real time, e.g, on a start/metro page.
This can be aggregated from a particular area/metro or from a particular set of cuisines, etc.
Optionally, we can also display dish stream on the restaurant page for a particular restaurant.

## [4] Public Timelines (Optional)

In order to support public timelines, we will need a “top diner timeline” listing screen and/or a search screen so that timelines can be searched.
When a timeline item is clicked on a search result or listing page/screen, the selected timeline page will be opened.
